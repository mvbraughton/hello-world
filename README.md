# hello-world

Hello Github community,

Malcolm here, I would classify myself as a programming hobbyist with a sick love for automation of the mundane and monitoring of the ordinary. Primary interests are in IOT and app development. Familarity in C++, C#, javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, and VBA. Hardware platforms include some Arduino but primarily Particle.
